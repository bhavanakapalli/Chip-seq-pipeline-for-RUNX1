Use this notebook to quickly write the methods for the week:


## Introduction

This week's analysis focuses on ChIP-seq data, aligning reads to the human reference genome, performing quality control, and analyzing binding site similarities across samples.

## Methods

### Source of Data

The ChIP-seq samples for this analysis were selected to investigate the binding sites of the Runx1 transcription factor. Data were retrieved from the GEO database (specific accession numbers to be provided), focusing on experiments that compare IP (immunoprecipitation) and control samples across different biological replicates.

### Quality Control

Initial quality control was performed using FastQC (v0.12.0), ensuring that our reads met the expected quality standards before proceeding with alignment.

### Aligning Reads

Reads were aligned to the human reference genome (GRCh38) using Bowtie2 (v2.4.2) with default parameters, directly converting the output to BAM files via Samtools (v1.10) for efficient storage and handling.

### Sorting and Indexing

Aligned BAM files were sorted and indexed using Samtools (v1.10), facilitating efficient access and manipulation of the sequence data for downstream analysis.

### Quality Control with Flagstats and MultiQC

Further quality control was executed with Samtools flagstat to assess alignment statistics. MultiQC (v1.9) aggregated these statistics along with initial QC reports to provide a comprehensive overview of data quality.

### Generating Bigwig Files

BAM files were converted to BigWig format using deepTools' bamCoverage (v3.5.1) with default parameters. This conversion facilitates efficient visualization and analysis of coverage across the genome.

### Comparing Similarity Between Samples

Sample similarity based on binding site intensities was quantitatively assessed using deepTools' multiBigwigSummary and plotCorrelation, generating a Pearson correlation heatmap to compare all samples.

### Tools and Software

- FastQC v0.12.0
- Bowtie2 v2.4.2
- Samtools v1.10
- MultiQC v1.9
- deepTools v3.5.1

## Conclusion

This week's analysis provided critical insights into the binding patterns of the Runx1 transcription factor across different samples, laying the groundwork for deeper biological interpretations in subsequent analyses.
