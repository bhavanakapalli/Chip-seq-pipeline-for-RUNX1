Methods

Data Processing Workflow

We developed a comprehensive data processing workflow using Snakemake, a scalable bioinformatics workflow engine, to automate the analysis of sequencing data derived from [specific experiment or study description]. The workflow integrates quality control, adapter trimming, and genome indexing steps, ensuring a standardized analysis pipeline for both subsampled and full sequencing datasets.

Sample Information and Data Retrieval

Sample metadata and sequencing data access information were organized in a sample_sheet.csv, which includes sample names, conditions, replicate identifiers, and FTP links to raw sequencing data. Sequencing data were downloaded from the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) using wget based on the FTP links specified in the sample sheet.

Quality Control

Quality control checks on raw sequencing data were performed using FastQC v0.11.9, assessing basic statistics, per-base sequence quality, sequence duplication levels, and overrepresented sequences. For each sample, both HTML reports and zipped data files were generated and stored in results/fastqc/full/, facilitating detailed quality assessments.

Adapter Trimming and Quality Filtering

Adapter sequences and low-quality bases were trimmed using Trimmomatic v0.39. The trimming process involved removing adapter sequences, leading and trailing bases with a quality score below 3, and scanning the read with a 4-base wide sliding window, cutting when the average quality per base drops below 15. The resulting high-quality trimmed reads for each sample were saved in samples/trimmed/full/.

Genome Indexing

To support the alignment of trimmed reads to the human reference genome, we constructed a Bowtie2 v2.4.2 index from the GRCh38 primary assembly. The index building was performed on decompressed reference genome FASTA files, with resulting index files stored in results/bowtie2_index/. This index facilitates efficient read mapping in subsequent analysis steps.

Computational Environment

All analyses were conducted on a high-performance computing cluster, leveraging Conda environments to manage software dependencies and ensure reproducibility. The Snakemake workflow was designed to scale dynamically based on the computational resources available, with specific rules configured to utilize up to 36 threads for intensive tasks such as adapter trimming and genome indexing.
