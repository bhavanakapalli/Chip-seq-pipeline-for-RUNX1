## Methods

### Data Source

The ChIP-seq datasets analyzed in this study correspond to experiments designed to investigate the binding sites of the RUNX1 transcription factor in human breast cancer cells.

### Quality Control and Alignment

Initial quality control was performed using `FastQC` v0.11.9, with default parameters to assess the quality of the raw sequencing reads. Sequencing reads were then aligned to the human reference genome (GRCh38/hg38) using `bowtie2` v2.4.2 with default parameters. The aligned reads were converted to BAM format using `samtools` v1.10 and sorted by coordinate.

### Peak Calling with HOMER

Peak calling was performed using the `HOMER` software suite. First, the `makeTagDirectory` utility was utilized to prepare the aligned reads for peak analysis, creating a tag directory for each sample. Peaks were then identified using the `findPeaks` command with the `-style factor` option to accommodate the narrow binding pattern typical of transcription factors like RUNX1. All operations were executed with default parameters unless otherwise noted.

### Peak Annotation and Motif Finding

The peaks identified by HOMER were annotated to the nearest genes using the `annotatePeaks.pl` script from the HOMER suite, specifying the `hg38` genome assembly. For motif discovery within the identified peaks, the `findMotifsGenome.pl` script was employed, analyzing the sequence content of the peaks to identify potential binding motifs. The reference genome used for motif finding was decompressed prior to analysis using `gunzip`, ensuring compatibility with HOMER's requirements.

### Reproducibility and Data Sharing

The entire analysis workflow, including quality control, alignment, peak calling, annotation, and motif discovery, was automated using `Snakemake`. The `Snakemake` workflow and all associated scripts are available in a public GitHub repository at [https://github.com/yourgithubaccount/yourproject](https://github.com/yourgithubaccount/yourproject). This repository includes detailed documentation of the analysis steps and software versions used, ensuring full reproducibility of the results.
